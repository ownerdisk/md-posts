This is the eighth analysis in my Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay album interpretation series. In this one, Iâ€™m going to be breaking down what I think is going on narratively on the track [Watching T.V.](https://youtu.be/BPJs2HNAjnA?si=Nmt5WGxqrsVM0ulH) My apologies for the lapse in posting, I promise I still have quite a lot to say. I have a 3-6 month hobby cycle and I am now back around to pontificating on this album!
